# World Wonders üåç

World Wonders is an educational web app aimed at making geography accessible and fun for everyone. Inspired by the popular game [GeoGuessr](https://www.geoguessr.com/), this app focuses on introducing users to basic geography concepts by only featuring globally recognizable landmarks and famous locations. Rather than overwhelming players with obscure places, World Wonders helps users build foundational knowledge in a simple, user-friendly way.

## Background
This project stemmed from research conducted to understand if learning geography posed challenges for people during their school years. Surveys, questionnaires, and interviews revealed that many struggled to learn geography effectively, often feeling disconnected from the material. World Wonders addresses this gap by providing a fun, interactive learning experience.

## Features
 -  **Famous Locations Only:** Instead of random and potentially difficult-to-recognize spots, users are presented with well-known landmarks, helping them start with familiar content.
 - **Interactive Learning:** Users can explore famous sites virtually and test their knowledge, reinforcing geographical concepts through engagement.
