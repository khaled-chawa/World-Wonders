# World Wonders üåç

World Wonders is an educational web app aimed at making geography accessible and fun for everyone. Inspired by the popular game [GeoGuessr](https://www.geoguessr.com/), this app focuses on introducing users to basic geography concepts by only featuring globally recognizable landmarks and famous locations. Rather than overwhelming players with obscure places, World Wonders helps users build foundational knowledge in a simple, user-friendly way.

## Background
This project stemmed from research conducted to understand if learning geography posed challenges for people during their school years. Surveys, questionnaires, and interviews revealed that many struggled to learn geography effectively, often feeling disconnected from the material. World Wonders addresses this gap by providing a fun, interactive learning experience.

## Features
 -  **Famous Locations Only:** Instead of random and potentially difficult-to-recognize spots, users are presented with well-known landmarks, helping them start with familiar content.
 - **Interactive Learning:** Users can explore famous sites virtually and test their knowledge, reinforcing geographical concepts through engagement.

## Getting Started
### Prerequisites

To run the World Wonders app, make sure you have:
 - Node.js and npm installed
 - A modern web browser

### Installation
 1. Clone this repo to your local machine
```
git clone https://github.com/khaled-chawa/World-Wonders.git
cd World-Wonder
```

 2. Install the dependencies
```npm install```

 3. Start the development server:
```npm start```

 4. Open your browser and go to `http://localhost:3000` to access the app.

## Usage
 1. Press on the burger menu in the top right and hit 'play'. This will redirect you to a google sign-in page. Complete the sign in using your gmail account.
 2. Then press on the burger menu in the top right again and hit 'play'.
 3. When presented with a picture, click where on the map in the bottom right you think you are and hit 'guess'.
 4. To see past scores, choose the 'history' button from the burger menu.

## Future changes
If I ever choose to come back to this project I would:
 1. Add more sign in options.
 2. Add different difficulty levels with different locations around the world.
 3. Add optoins for learning, for example if someone wanted to learn the different biomes/landscapes that can be found in a certain region the game would should pictures of that region and they would have to guess where in the area they are.
 4. Add a multiplayer game mode so a teacher can set up a game in their classroom like [Kahoot](https://kahoot.com/) where all the students would use a code to enter the game and after each image is displayed the teacher's screen would show all the students' guesses and then their scores.
